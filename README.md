# ENCS5323 Online Calculator for Wireless and Mobile Networks

This repository contains the implementation of an online calculator specifically designed for educational and practical use in the field of wireless and mobile networks. This tool is aimed at students, engineers, and professionals who require quick calculations for various parameters and rates involved in wireless communication systems.

## Project Overview

The ENCS5323 Online Calculator facilitates calculations across five different aspects of wireless and mobile network design and analysis. It provides a user-friendly interface to input specifications and view calculated results for various network components and techniques.

## Features

1. **Communication System Components Calculation**:
   - Calculate the number of bits and rates for samplers, quantizers, source encoders, channel encoders, and interleavers.

2. **OFDM System Calculations**:
   - Determine the number of bits and rates for resource elements, OFDM symbols, Resource Blocks, and maximum transmission capabilities using parallel resource blocks.

3. **Power Transmission Calculations**:
   - Compute the power transmitted in a flat environment based on given transmitter and receiver specifications.

4. **Throughput Calculations for Multiple Access Techniques**:
   - Analyze throughput in percentage terms for various multiple access techniques.

5. **Cellular System Design**:
   - Aid in the design of cellular systems with considerations for various network parameters and infrastructure needs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: For building the frontend interface and ensuring interactive and responsive design.
